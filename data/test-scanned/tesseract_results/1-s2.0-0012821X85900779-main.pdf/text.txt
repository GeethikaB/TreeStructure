Revised version received January 11, 1985

The concentrations of nine rare earth elements (REE) La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er and Yb, have been determined
in mixed species assemblages of foraminifera tests taken from Atlantic Ocean sediment core tops. Reductive cleaning
techniques have revealed that REE are present in three phases in foraminifera tests collected from sea floor sediments;
REE included in the foraminiferal calcite matrix (termed lattice REE), REE associated with an authigenic FeMn-rich
phase adsorbed onto the surface of the test following the death of the organism (termed coating REE) and REE
associated with alumino-silicatedetritus (termed detrital REE) which commonly infills the test chambers after burial in
the sediment. The concentrations of REE in the nondetrital (lattice plus coating) and lattice phases have been measured
in this study. Approximately 90% of the REE measured in the non-detrital phase reside in the coating phase, the
remainder being present in the lattice phase. These data have been used to investigate the relationship between the
distribution of dissolved REE in the ocean and in the coating and lattice phases. In addition to the REE the
concentrations of Mn, Fe, Cu, A1 and PO4 have been measured as an aid to characterisation of the various phases.

studies have also utilised the trace element contents of foraminiferal calcite to deduce the history

bility constants of R E E complexes vary in an
ordered way. H e n c e p a r t i o n i n g of the R E E between phases m a y lead to fractionation of the light
R E E relative to the heavy REE. A l t h o u g h the
R E E exist p r e d o m i n a n t l y as 3 + cations in the
m a r i n e e n v i r o n m e n t , there are i m p o r t a n t exceptions, n a m e l y Ce which can exist as Ce 4÷ a n d Eu
which can exist as Eu 2+ T h u s these two elements
m a y fractionate from the 3 + cations as a f u n c t i o n
of redox potential [6-8]. The d i s t r i b u t i o n of dissolved heavy R E E in the water c o l u m n is very
similar to that of Si [8-11], thus their concentrations in foraminiferal calcite m a y serve as proxy
indicators of oceanic silicate concentrations.
This investigation was u n d e r t a k e n to evaluate
the potential of using the R E E c o n c e n t r a t i o n s in
foraminiferal calcite as palaeo-ocean chemistry indicators b y d e t e r m i n i n g whether the analytical
m e t h o d s e m p l o y e d allow reproducible results to be
o b t a i n e d which can then be logically explained in
terms of the chemical properties of the REE.

2. Sample strategy
Within an individual foraminifera species different sized individuals have differing carbon and
oxygen isotope ratios [12]. In addition, the distribution of some elements (e.g. Mg), and oxygen
and carbon isotopes may not be homogeneous
within an individual test [13-15]. There are also
considerable inter-species differences in trace element concentrations [3,16]. However, the amount
of cleaned foraminiferal calcite required for the
REE analyses (at least 5 mg) and the bulk sample
size available (3 g) did not allow single species to
be analysed. Whilst this inhibits the use of these
data in precise geographical studies it will be shown
that the approach adopted here has yielded valuable information concerning the controls over the
incorporation of REE in foraminiferal calcite
which may be used in later, more specific, investigations.

oped a reductive cleaning method to remove such
coatings. The technique consists of physically
cleaning the tests (as described above) followed by
soaking the crushed CaCO 3 in a warm reducing
solution [3].
Following the soaking stage above, the reducing
solution was drained off and the sample ultrasonically agitated in QD H 2 0 and QD methanol three
times each, for intervals of one minute, to remove
any remaining traces of the solution. The sample
was transferred to a teflon bottle containing 20 ml
of QD H 2 0 and dissolved by bubbling filtered
CO 2 gas through the water for six hours. The
bottle was immersed in an ice bath to increase the
solubility of CO 2. The sample was then centri-

3.1. Sample preparation
Samples were taken from the top 1 cm of
carbonate-rich cores from the Atlantic Ocean.
Where possible sediment was taken from trigger
weight and box cores as these contain the least
disturbed sediment tops. The core locations are
listed in the Appendix 1.
The raw sediment was disaggregated by soaking
overnight in distilled water. The sediment slurry
was then sieved through a 170 ~tm mesh and
washed thoroughly to remove sea salts. The nonforaminiferal material was removed from the remaining sediment by hand picking under a binocular microscope. The tests were crushed with a glass
rod to break open the chambers and repeatedly
ultrasonically cleaned in quartz distilled (QD) H 2 0
and QD methanol until the supernatant remained
clear. The samples were re-examined under a binocular microscope to ensure that all visible adhering detritus had been removed.
The FeMn-rich coating is chemically bound to
the foraminiferal calcite and cannot be removed
by physical cleaning methods alone. Boyle devel-

To determine the optimum cleaning temperature five splits of an homogenised sample were
cleaned for 30 minutes at 25°C, 50°C, 65°C, 80°C
and 90°C. The time required for effective cleaning
was determined by cleaning five further splits of
the same sample at 80°C for 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60
minutes. The results of these experiments are illustrated in Fig. 1.
On the basis of these results a cleaning regime
of 30 minutes at 80°C was routinely employed for
removal of the coating phase.

The results are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The
average REE patterns of the non-detrital and
lattice phases (normalised to average shale [19])
are illustrated in Fig. 2, together with range in
concentrations for each element. The shapes of the
non-detrital REE patterns do not vary significantly between different samples (with the exception of Ce). Similarly the shapes of the lattice REE
patterns are very similar to one another. The data
precision is discussed below.

3.2. Sample analysis

4. Data evaluation

Elemental concentrations in the non-detrital
phase were determined by dissolving the sample
overnight in 0.1 M QD HC1 (after ultrasonic cleaning). Concentrations in the lattice phase were determined using the techniques described above.
The REE concentrations were determined by
mass spectrometric isotope dilution [17]. Fe, Mn,
Cu and Al concentrations were determined by
atomic absorption spectrophotometry. PO 4 concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically
using a continuous flow autoanalyser. Ca con-

To assess the analytical reproducibility a further ten splits of the homogenised sample (the
same as that used in the cleaning experiments)
were taken and the lattice and non-detrital concentrations were determined in five splits each.
The results are summarised in Table 3. The precision is excellent for all the elements measured,
with the exception of Cu which, as found by Boyle
[3], suffers from residual contamination.
The FeMn-rich coating incorporates high concentrations of a wide variety of trace elements
[3,20]. This is well illustrated for the REE by the
relatively high correlation coefficients between the

3). A measure of the effectiveness of the cleaning
technique is given by the absence of any significant correlation between the lattice REE and Fe
concentrations (see Fig. 3).
No significant relationship is observed between
either non-detrital or lattice REE and AI concentrations, suggesting that detrital contamination
is less serious for the REE compared to uranium
[21]. However, if it is assumed that all the A1
measured is in fact due to residual detrital contamination, and that this detrital material has
REE/A1 ratios similar to those of shale and deepsea pelagic clays [6,7,19,22], the percentage of REE
derived from this contaminant source can be

estimated. The average contribution of detrital
REE to the REE measured in the non-detrital
phase is calculated to be less than 4% (maximum
of 10% for sample V23-41TW). For the lattice
phase, detrital REE contamination is less than
0.4%, i.e., within analytical error.
As a comparative check a men•specific sample
(V22-219 G. truncatuloides) cleaned by Ed Boyle at
M.I.T. was analysed for REE at Leeds. The results
fall well within the range of values observed in this
study (see Table 4). There is also good agreement
between the average lattice AI, Cu, Mn and Fe

of Boyle [3].

centrations measured in this study are less than
those observed by Boyle [3] despite the close similarity in the average values. This may be because
Boyle [3] considers that some of the high Fe, Mn
and A1 concentrations he observed after cleaning
are due to slight residual contamination.
In five cases there was sufficient sample available to permit both lattice and non-detrital REE
concentrations to be determined. No clear relationship exists between the REE concentrations in
both phases. This indicates that the cleaning technique removes all significant amounts of REE in
the non-lattice phases and not just a proportion of
the coating.
Because marine phosphatic phases are rich in
REE [6,7,23-25] it is important to assess the influence of residual PO 4 contamination on the REE
concentrations reported here. The upper limit of
Nd concentrations in m o d e m phosphorites and
fish debris is approximately 2 # m o l / g [6,7,24,25].
Using this N d / P O 4 ratio and the PO 4 concentrations measured here, a maximum of 2% of the Nd
in the lattice phase and 10% in the non-detrital
phase are calculated to be associated with residual
PO 4. These are upper limits and the probable
extent of residual PO 4 contamination is less than
half these values.

In all cases the blank levels lay within the
precisions quoted above.
All the above evidence indicates that the reductive cleaning procedure is effective in removing all
significant amounts of REE present in non-detrital
contaminant phases, thus allowing the lattice REE
concentrations to be accurately determined.

5. Discussion

5.1. Coating REE
The composition of the coating may be determined by assuming that the amount of Ca
associated with the coating is negligible compared
with that present in the biogenically precipitated
calcite, i.e., the difference between the Ca concentrations in the lattice and non-detrital phases is
assumed to be solely due to dilution of the Ca in
the non-detrital phase by the coating weight. From
the lattice R E E / C a molar ratios and the non-detrital REE and Ca concentrations it is possible to
determine the proportions of the non-detrital REE
present in the coating and lattice phases (the nondetrital concentrations are corrected for residual
detrital contamination in the manner described
above). The weight of the coating, and hence its
REE concentration is given by:
coating weight = sample weight
X [1 -- ( [Ca]n°n'detrital ) ]

[Ca]lattice
where [Ca] is the Ca concentration in the relevant
phase. The Ca concentrations are the averages in
the two phases and the sample weight is the average for the samples analysed for their non-detrital
concentrations.
The weight of the coating may also be determined by assuming it consists entirely of Fe203
and MnO 2 and using the measured non-detrital Fe
and Mn concentrations (assuming that the Fe and
Mn associated with the lattice phase is negligible).
This method yields coating weights that are approximately 25% higher than those calculated from
the Ca concentrations.
The average of these two calculations, together

with the average REE, Mn and Fe concentrations
in other types of FeMn-rich deposits, are shown in
Table 5. Although the concentrations in the coating phase are at most only precise to 2570, the
interelement relationships and the REE pattern
shapes are not affected.
The source of the REE in the coating phase has
not yet been unequivocally determined. It is likely
that foraminifera tests scavenge some REE from
the water column during their descent to the sea
floor. However, the long residence time of foraminifera at the sediment-water interface (of the
order of hundreds of years) compared to their
rapid fall through the water column (of the order
of days [28]) strongly suggests that the major source
of REE in the coating phase is either from bottom
water or pore water. If inorganic scavenging of
reactive dissolved elements (like the REE [8]) is an
equilibrium process, with chemical exchange between trace elements associated with solid phases
and the surrounding water [29,30], then during the
long residence time of the foraminifera tests in the
top 1 cm of the sediment the REE in the coating
phase will have reached equilibrium with the REE
in the pore waters a n d / o r bottom waters.
Although there are, as yet, no published profiles
of REE concentrations in pore waters, preliminary
data (H. Elderfield, personal communication) suggest that there is a benthic flux of REE to the deep
oceans. This tentative conclusion is supported by
observations of near bottom enrichments of REE
in the water column [9,11] and diagenetic recycling
of REE in sediment underlying Mn nodules in
areas of the Pacific Ocean [23].
Hence it is likely that REE in the coating phase
are derived from interstitial waters, although
scavenging of REE from bottom waters by Fe-rich
flocs and subsequent inclusion in the coating phase
cannot be ruled out, especially in light of the
negative curvature observed for dissolved REE
plots against conservative tracers in areas of the
deep Atlantic [8,9,11].
The average REE concentrations in the coating
phase are higher than generally reported for other
FeMn-rich deposits (see Table 5). The lower concentrations observed in FeMn-rich deposits may
be due to dilution of a REE-bearing Fe phase with
diagenetic Mn [31] and uncertainties in determin-

o~~

ing the coating weight in this study.
To accurately assess the controls over the incorporation of REE in the coating phase we must
have some knowledge of the distribution of dissolved REE in pore waters and bottom waters. As
mentioned above, as yet there are no reliable measurements of REE concentrations in pore waters.
There are some data available for bottom water
REE concentrations in the Atlantic [9,11], and if,
as seems likely, there is a REE benthic flux these
waters will have a similar REE pattern to that of
the uppermost pore waters in contact with the
foraminifera at the sediment-water interface. However, the complex circulation of the deep Atlantic
makes it difficult to distinguish between water
mass effects and effects arising from aspects of the
marine geochemical cycle of the REE. Whilst these
problems are recognised it will be shown that the
distribution of REE in the coating phase (relative
to bottom waters) is consistent with their chemical
properties and scavenging processes operating in
the marine environment.
Fig. 4 illustrates the REE patterns of the coating phase and of bottom waters from the eastern
equatorial Atlantic [11]. (The data of DeBaar et al.
[9] were not used as these authors measured a
different suite of REE, however their results are
consistent with those data used here and would
produce a similar pattern.) Also contained in Fig.
4 is the REE pattern obtained from normalising
the coating REE concentrations to those in the
bottom water. This latter REE pattern contains
two distinct features. Part I shows a steep fall in
the coating/water ratio from Eu to Yb, with part
II showing a shallower rise from La to Eu.
The mechanism by which scavenging of trace
metals by particulates takes place is complicated
and not well understood. Explanations based on
surface chemical theory [32] have not been entirely
successful [29]. These studies are handicapped by
the large number of particulate phases involved in
the scavenging process [33]. A further complication is introduced by the detection of an organic
film of unknown thickness on particulate surfaces
which may have some impact on the scavenging
process [34,35]. Balistrieri et al. [33] considered
that pure oxides alone cannot account for the
scavenging ability of sinking particulate matter.

They indicate that metal interactions with particulates are controlled by organic compounds
coating the oxides or by organic compounds themselves. These organic-soluble metal interactions can
be described by a reaction between organic
carboxylic acid groups with the metal free ion. If
this hypothesis is correct, the proportions of the
dissolved REE present as the free ion will be
important. The calculated speciations of the dissolved 3 + cations of the REE are illustrated in
Fig. 5a [36]. The REE between Gd and Yb have
distinctly lower percentages of the dissolved species
present as the free ion relative to the lighter REE.
This difference can be invoked to explain the
enrichment of Eu over Yb in part II of the coating/water REE pattern. However, if this process
was the sole control over the incorporation of REE
in the coating phase, the relative free ion concentrations of Eu and La indicate that an enrichment of La over Eu should be observed in the
coating water REE pattern; evidently this is not
SO.

Brewer and Hao [29] have shown that for some
elements there is good agreement between the
intensity of adsorption of trace metals onto par-

tive free ion concentrations of the dissolved REE
is a dominant control over the distribution of the
REE between the coating and dissolved phases.
This is in accordance with observations that for
elements with similar surface stability constants
(as would be expected for a chemically coherent
group like the REE) the scavenging residence time
is inversely related to the proportion of the dissolved metal present as the free ion [33,38]. However, the relatively high solubility of the light REE
hydroxides, compared to those of the heavy REE,
prevents their large enrichments in the coating
phase predicted from free ion considerations alone,
and leads to their depletion relative to Eu.

ticulate matter and the stability of cation-hydroxide groups. The solubility constants (log Ks(OH))
for the REE hydroxides [37,38] are illustrated in
Fig. 5b. There is a large decrease in solubility of
the REE hydroxides on moving across the group
from La to Gd, with less variability between the
solubilities of the heavy REE hydroxides (the position of Eu may be anomalous as some authors [39]
consider that the solubility of Eu(OH) 3 is similar
to that of Gd(OH)3). If it is assumed that the
coating phase consists predominantly of Feoxyhydroxides [20] this variation in hydroxide
solubilities can qualitatively explain the observed
enrichments of Eu over La in part II of the coating/water REE pattern.
The general enrichment of the light REE over
the heavy REE in the coating, and the strong
enrichment of Eu over Yb, indicates that the rela-

The lattice phase REE concentrations are approximately an order of magnitude lower than the
concentrations of REE in the non-detrital phase,
and three orders of magnitude lower than the
coating phase REE concentrations (see Table 5).
Shaw and Wasserburg [41] reported very low
(20 n m o l / g ) concentrations of Nd in mollusc
high-Mg calcite/aragonite but insufficient details
were provided in this abstract to warrant a detailed comparison with the data from this study.
Oxygen isotope data indicate that the average
calcification depth of Atlantic planktonic foraminifera is approximately 100 m [42]. The REE
pattern obtained from normalising the average
REE concentrations in 100 m deep Atlantic Ocean
water [8,11] is illustrated in Fig. 6. Three values
are given for Ce [8,9,11] to illustrate the greater
variability shown by dissolved Ce concentrations
in near surface waters relative to the other REE.
An alternative method of representing the enrichment of lattice REE relative to seawater dissolved REE is to use the distribution coefficient,
KD, where:
KD

\ ( R E E / C a ) . . . . ater ]

these values are presented in Table 6.
The mechanisms by which trace metals are included in the calcite matrix of foraminifera are
complicated [43]. In addition to the chemical properties of calcite and the dissolved metals it is likely

that there are also biological (" vital") processes
controlling the uptake of trace metals by plankton.
Although the REE have not been shown to be
required by organisms for their healthy metabolism it is known that other trace metals (e.g. Fe,
Mn, Zn, Cu) are actively involved in planktonic
biochemical processes [44]. It is not known whether
plankton remove these, or other elements, from
seawater as free ions or in the form of organic or
inorganic complexes.
Several studies have shown that the ionic radii

of the REE cations exert a major control over their
substitution for Ca in a variety of mineral phases
[45-47]. Fig. 7 illustrates the plot of K D against
R E E ionic radii. The ionic radii are for the six
coordinate ions (i.e., characteristic of substitution
into the calcite structure) [48-50]. Note that both
naturally occurring oxidation states of cerium
( C e 3+ and C e 4 + ) and europium (Eu 2+ and E u 3 + )
are considered; all other REE are considered to
exist as 3 + cations in seawater.
There is a good correlation between K D and
the similarity of the ionic radii of the REE to that
of Ca 2÷ The observation that both Ce 4+ and Eu 3+
lie on the trend line in Fig. 7 (whereas Ce 3+ and
E u 2 + do not) indicates the form in which they are
removed from seawater [40]. Morgan and Wandless [46] have also noted that the light REE, with
ionic radii similar to that of Ca 2+, are preferentially enriched in anhydrite relative to the smaller
heavy REE cations.
Another factor which may influence the relative
enrichment of the REE in foraminiferal calcite is
the solubility of their carbonate salts. The distribution coefficients of the R E E are substantially higher
(130-170) than that of Cd (1.5) [3,51] despite the
fact that both Ca 2+ and Cd 2+ form divalent cations and have similar ionic radii (1.00 A and 0.95
respectively [47-49]). There are several possible

reasons for this apparent discrepancy. Although it
is possible that vital effects result in foraminifera
actively excluding Cd because of its toxicity, inorganic CaCO 3 precipitation experiments [52] also
show Cd has a low distribution coefficient (13-30).
The inorganic chemical properties of Cd and the
REE also play important roles in determining their
relative enrichments in foraminiferal calcite. An
insight into the differences between the distribution coefficients of Cd and the REE can be obtained through solid-solution theory. The theoretical distribution coefficient is given by [32]:

where K~ is the solubility of the relevant carbonate

this equation are given in Table 7. Care must be
taken in interpreting these numbers. A large source
of uncertainty results from the experimental determinations of the solubility products which were
not determined under standard or even equivalent
conditions [53,54]. The observed distribution coefficients are lower than those predicted by the
solubility products because of the increased activity coefficients of trace elements in a solid solute
[32]. Although the limitations of the theoretical

light REE in the calcite lattice relative to the heavy
REE (see Fig. 8) and they predict the low K D
values for Cd compared to the REE. In addition,
Turner and Whitfield [38] interpret the high concentrations of REE in many marine phases in
terms of their high polarising power which results
in stabilisation of the surrounding crystal structure.
It was demonstrated above that the enrichment
of the light REE relative to the heavy REE in the
coating phase appears to be dependent, to some
extent, on the proportions of the dissolved REE
present as the free ion. Although the light REE
have higher K D values in the lattice and they have
a higher proportion of free ions in the dissolved
state, the relationship is not as clear as for the
coating phase. This might be expected from the
speculation that plankton do not take up trace
metals as free ions, but probably as singly charged
hydtoxy or chloro complexes [44] and the even
greater uncertainty regarding the relationship between the ion uptake and calcification processes.

5.3. The role of foraminifera in the marine geochemical cycle of the REE
If the lattice REE concentrations are compared
to the R E E / C a ratios in the Atlantic water column [8,9,11] (see Table 8) it can be seen that
foraminiferal calcite is not a significant carrier
phase for REE in the oceans. However, if the data
from this study are extrapolated on a global basis,
the non-detrital phase (i.e., coating plus lattice) of
calcareous sediments is a significant sink for the
REE, removing 30% (for Ce) to 45% (for La) of
the dissolved R E E supplied to the oceans by
riverine transport [55].

6. Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that the reductive
cleaning techniques developed by Boyle [3] are
successful in allowing the lattice REE concentrations of foraminiferal calcite to be precisely measured. This has also allowed the determination of
R E E concentrations in the FeMn-rich phase.

The REE distribution in the coating phase,
relative to bottom water, is controlled by the proportions of dissolved REE present as the free ion,
leading to a general enrichment of the light REE
over the heavy REE, and by the relative stability
of the REE-hydroxyl complexes, leading to a slight
enrichment of Eu over La.
The distribution of the REE in the lattice phase,
relative to REE seawater concentrations at the
foraminiferal calcification depth, appears to be
controlled by the similarity of the ionic radii of the
REE cations to that of Ca 2÷ and by the solubility
of the REE carbonate salts.
The consistency of the data presented here with
the chemical properties of the REE paves the way
for more detailed studies to explore the use of the
lattice REE distributions as indices of palaeooceanographic conditions.
